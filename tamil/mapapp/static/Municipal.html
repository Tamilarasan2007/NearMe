    Kallakurichi Municipality is the local governing body responsible for managing civic services in Kallakurichi, the district headquarters of Tamil Nadu’s Kallakurichi district. Spread over nearly 16 square kilometers and divided into 21 wards, the municipality provides essential services such as water supply, sanitation, road maintenance, waste management, and public health. Established as a town panchayat in 1968, it was gradually upgraded and became a first-grade municipality in 2010, reflecting the town’s steady growth. With an elected council and a municipal commissioner overseeing its operations, Kallakurichi Municipality plays a key role in improving infrastructure, promoting urban development, and ensuring the well-being of its residents.
