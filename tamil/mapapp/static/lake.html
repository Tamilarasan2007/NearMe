    Emapper Lake, located in Kallakurichi district, Tamil Nadu, is both an ecological and community landmark. The lake is known as a birding hotspot where nature enthusiasts can spot various species, making it important for biodiversity. At the same time, it serves as a vital water resource for the local population. However, like many urban and semi-urban water bodies, Emapper Lake faces challenges of pollution, with plastic and other waste threatening its ecosystem. Local groups, NGOs, and the municipality have been organizing clean-up drives to restore its beauty and raise awareness about conservation. This blend of natural richness and community effort makes Emapper Lake a place of both environmental significance and social responsibility.
